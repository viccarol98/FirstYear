         <img class="fotomain" src="f8.jpg" alt="">
        <P class="p4"><strong>We texted each other on <strong>April 12, 2024 </strong>for the first time. There was a gap between <strong>April 15 to April 22 </strong>and I feel so bad about it still, I am so glad you did not give up on this crazy girl who ghosted you haha. <strong>At May 2, 2024</strong>, we finally meet up and after then, we never stopped talking anymore. Next day you said that you were looking for long term relationship and wanted to keep getting to know me. That same evening (<strong>May 3</strong>) you talked about the soccer game that later on would be when you asked me to be your girlfriend, next day you got the tickets LOL. <strong>At May 5</strong>, we went to see a movie and I got home at <strong>2:37am.</strong> On <strong>May 10</strong>, we have our picnic with your brigadeiro and then we headed to Rattlesnack lake for the <strong>Northern Lights</strong>. On <strong>may 18</strong>, after the soccer game, <strong>*you asked me in Portuguese if I wanna be your girlfriend*</strong> ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è</strong>  </P>
        
        <p class="p5"> <strong>This whole year has been a great adventure, we did so much together. Things that I would not imagine doing and you came to make my life waay better! We did camping, hiking, we travelled together and went to Harry Potter world. I am a better person because of you.</strong></p>
